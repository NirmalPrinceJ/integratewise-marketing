  { quote: "IntegrateWise eliminated 12 hours of weekly manual data reconciliation. Our team now focuses on strategy instead of spreadsheets.", author: "Sarah Chen", role: "VP Revenue Operations", company: "TechServe", rating: 5 },

const SHARED_FAQ = [
  { question: "How long does implementation take?", answer: "Most teams are fully operational in under 2 weeks. Our guided onboarding configures connectors, maps schemas, and calibrates the intelligence layer to your specific business context. Enterprise deployments with custom integrations typically take 4-6 weeks." },
  { question: "Do I need technical expertise to use IntegrateWise?", answer: "No. IntegrateWise is designed for business operators — CSMs, RevOps, and leadership teams. Connector setup is OAuth-based (one click), and the AI surfaces insights in plain language. Developers can access our API for custom integrations." },
  { question: "How does IntegrateWise handle data security?", answer: "We employ encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access control, audit trails for every action, and governance gates at every layer. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and GDPR-ready. Data never leaves your region without explicit configuration." },
  { question: "What integrations are supported?", answer: "We support 12+ native connectors including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Stripe, Slack, Jira, Intercom, Snowflake, and more. Custom connectors can be built via our API. New integrations are added monthly based on customer demand." },
  { question: "How is this different from Zapier or Workato?", answer: "Traditional iPaaS tools move data. IntegrateWise understands data. We don't just sync — we normalize into the Unified Intelligence Layer, reason with AI, detect patterns, and surface actionable intelligence. Think of us as the intelligence layer on top of your integrations." },
  { question: "Is there a free tier?", answer: "Yes. Our Starter plan includes up to 3 connectors, 1,000 events/month, and access to the core intelligence features. It's designed for small teams and students who want to learn integration intelligence." },
