                        It started with a quiet drift that almost cost us everything. Our oldest client
                        stopped renewing. The CRM showed them as "active." The accounting showed an unpaid
                        invoice. By the time we saw the red, the relationship was already dead.

                      <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
                        Three weeks before the invoice turned red, the behavioral signals were already amber:
                        integration calls had slowed 40%, usage shifted from daily to weekly, engagement
                        depth had evaporated.

                      <p>
                        That night, we realized: most businesses don't have a revenue problem.
                        They have a <strong>visibility problem</strong>. We built IntegrateWise to
                        fix our own blindness first.
